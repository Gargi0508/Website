        <h2>1. Generative AI in drug design</h2>
        <p>A 2010 study showed the average cost of taking a drug from discovery to market was about $1.8 billion, of which drug discovery costs represented about a third, and the discovery process took a whopping three to six years. Generative AI has already been used to design drugs for various uses within months, offering pharma significant opportunities to reduce both the costs and timeline of drug discovery.</p>

        <h2>2. Generative AI in material science</h2>
        <p>Generative AI is impacting the automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, electronics, and energy industries by composing entirely new materials targeting specific physical properties. The process, called inverse design, defines the required properties and discovers materials likely to have those properties rather than relying on serendipity to find a material that possesses them. The result is to find, for example, materials that are more conductive or have greater magnetic attraction than those currently used in energy and transportation — or for use cases where materials need to be resistant to corrosion.</p>

        <h2>3. Generative AI in chip design</h2>
        <p>Generative AI can use reinforcement learning (a machine learning technique) to optimize component placement in semiconductor chip design (floorplanning), reducing the product-development life cycle time from weeks with human experts to hours with generative AI.</p>

<h2>4. Generative AI in synthetic data</h2>
<p>Generative AI is one way of creating synthetic data, which is a class of data that is generated rather than obtained from direct observations of the real world. This ensures the privacy of the original sources of the data that was used to train the model. For example, healthcare data can be artificially generated for research and analysis without revealing the identity of patients whose medical records were used to ensure privacy.</p>

<h2>5. Generative design of parts</h2>
<p>Generative AI enables industries, including manufacturing, automotive, aerospace, and defense, to design parts that are optimized to meet specific goals and constraints, such as performance, materials, and manufacturing methods. For example, automakers can use generative design to innovate lighter designs — contributing to their goals of making cars more fuel efficient.</p>

  <p>These are just a few of the many potential applications of generative AI. As the technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more innovative and groundbreaking uses.</p>
