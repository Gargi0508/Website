      <p>Generative AI refers to a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on creating models and systems capable of generating new and original content. It involves using machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and structures from existing data, and then using that knowledge to generate new data that resembles the training examples.</p>
      <p>Generative AI techniques are often based on deep learning models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs). These models are trained on large datasets to capture the underlying distribution and statistical properties of the data. Once trained, they can generate new samples that resemble the training data, but are not identical to it.</p>
      <p>One of the key characteristics of generative AI is its ability to produce outputs that are novel and diverse. For example, a generative AI system trained on a dataset of images can generate new images that resemble the training set but contain unique variations and details. Similarly, a text-based generative AI model can produce original sentences, stories, or even entire articles.</p>
      <p>Generative AI has been applied to various domains, including image synthesis, text generation, music composition, and even video game design. It has found applications in fields such as art, design, entertainment, and research.</p>`;
